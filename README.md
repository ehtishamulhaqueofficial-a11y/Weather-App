# 🌤️ Weather App

This is my first project created completely on my own without following tutorials.  
It’s a beginner-friendly **Weather Application** that uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch real-time weather data.

## ✨ Features
- Search weather by city name.
- Displays temperature in Celsius.
- Shows last updated time and date.
- Simple and clean UI built with HTML & CSS.
- Error handling for invalid or empty city names.
- Different icons for hot and cold weather.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- WeatherAPI

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add autocomplete suggestions while typing city names.
- Show extra details like humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.
- Make design more responsive and stylish.
